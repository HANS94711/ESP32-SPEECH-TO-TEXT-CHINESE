# ESP32-SPEECH-TO-TEXT-CHINESE
This project demonstrates how to achieve real-time speech-to-text conversion using an ESP32 microcontroller, an INMP441 microphone, and a simple button connected to GPIO 4. To get started, ensure your ESP32 and computer are connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Once set up, you'll be able to capture and convert spoken words to text in real-time.
